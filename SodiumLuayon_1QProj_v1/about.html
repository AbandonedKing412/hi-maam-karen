      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Eco Ways began in 2022, as a simple SCALE project at school. A small group of friends who simply enjoyed being outdoors, exploring forests, and spending time by the riverside. 
        What started as fun hangouts soon opened our eyes to the growing problem of trash, deforestation, 
        and pollution in the places we loved most. We realized that if people didn‚Äôt start caring for nature, the beauty we 
        enjoyed might disappear for future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, our activities were simple, picking up litter and planting trees in vacant lots. 
        But as more classmates, neighbors, and even teachers joined us, Eco Ways slowly grew from a SCALE project to an actual advocacy. 
        Today, we continue to share our passion for nature through school projects, community clean-ups, and 
        seminars that inspire others to live sustainably. What started as just a small group of 
        friends having fun has now become a movement that proves even the smallest beginnings can create a 
        lasting impact.
